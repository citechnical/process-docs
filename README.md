Security related intelligence will not be part of this documentation. If you follow these guidelines precisely, things may still not work. We believe in the philosophy of enlightenment and sharing, but we will not put our business at risk. Some security measures are also subject to U.S. Export controls, therefore this information may be needed for specific implementations but will NOT be dissemminated here. In these instances, we may or may not provide links to other public articles to accomplish these tasks.

All the documents in this repository and others are also managed in an Atlassian Confluence installation at CITechnical.com. Please feel free to contribute with corrections, updates, or new articles.
